/**
 * Is this asset shippable?
 *
 * `inspectGltf` already reports what a file contains and flags suspicious
 * things as prose. That answers "what is in it", not "may it ship" — which is a
 * question about a project's standards, not about the file.
 *
 * So this is a pure function over an inspection plus a policy: no I/O, no
 * provider, fully testable, and easy to point at a studio whose thresholds
 * differ from ours. Defaults are deliberately conservative but every one of
 * them is overridable, because an asset failing someone else's house style is
 * not a defect.
