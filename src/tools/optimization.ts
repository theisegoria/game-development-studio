/**
 * The bounded optimisation loop and self-diagnosis, on the registry.
 *
 * goal-create and goal-evaluate are the performance-optimisation feature: a
 * metric, a direction, a target, an iteration budget and a patch allowlist,
 * evaluated candidate by candidate until met or exhausted. They were CLI-only,
 * which meant the surface built for a model to optimise its own renderer was
 * the one surface a shell-less model could not reach.
 *
 * Both write into the project's .game-dev/goals directory, so they take the
 * project-write authority, with free plan_* twins that need none. doctor is
 * read-only and needs nothing: a model that can ask what is wrong with its
 * environment can fix it instead of guessing.
