/**
 * Call a tool the way a client actually calls it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Before this harness, no test in the suite invoked a tool
 * through its registered handler — the suite tested domain helpers and the
 * Blender subprocess and stopped at the tool boundary. That gap has a specific,
 * repeated signature: a value is computed correctly and then dropped on its way
 * into the response.
 *
 *   - `weldSkipped` was computed by the normalizer and dropped by the batch.
 *   - `factorApplied` was accepted in a signature, declared on the receipt type,
 *     passed by two call sites, headlined in a release note, and never copied
 *     into the object — so every consumer read `undefined`.
 *   - `stdoutTruncated` was set correctly and reached no tool response at all.
 *
 * Every one of those is invisible to a helper-level test by construction: the
 * helper is right. Only a caller reading the actual response can see it. And
 * optional-property typing means `tsc` reports nothing.
 *
 * This connects the real operation modules to the framework-free local
 * registry, so the assertions run against the same validated JSON the CLI
 * receives — no subprocess, build step, network, or MCP transport.
