/**
 * A software rasterizer is not a GPU, and an adapter must not be able to say
 * otherwise.
 *
 * lavapipe, llvmpipe and SwiftShader all produce correct-looking pixels on the
 * CPU. An adapter that reported GPU execution for such a lane -- by mistake, or
 * by copy-paste from a hardware lane -- would mint authority it never earned,
 * and every downstream claim would inherit it. So the harness does not trust
 * and flag the declaration; it overwrites it.
 *
 * What the lane IS good for is the reason to keep it: a CPU rasterizer is
 * bit-deterministic where a real GPU is not, which makes it the only honest way
 * to run a zero-threshold visual regression gate in CI.
