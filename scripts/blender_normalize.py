This script is FIXED and shipped with the server. Options arrive as one JSON

interpolated into Python source.

It exists because generated and marketplace meshes routinely arrive in a state
no renderer will accept: no UVs (so they cannot be textured at all), degenerate
triangles, unnamed materials, blend modes that make an opaque object
transparent. Fixing those by hand is the step that stalls an asset pipeline.

# `dissolve_degenerate` removes a face by its ALTITUDE, not by its shortest
# edge — in Blender 5.2 a triangle with base 1.0 and every edge >= 0.5 is
# removed at altitude 1e-7 and kept at 1e-6. An altitude can be arbitrarily
# smaller than the shortest edge, so this factor does NOT prove the dissolve
# reaches only degenerate faces; a sliver with long edges can still go.
#
# It is kept because the direction is benign and the alternative is worse: a
# non-sliver thin face necessarily HAS a short edge, so the edge minimum is a
# sound proxy for ordinary geometry, and no destruction of realistic geometry
# through this gap has been demonstrated. Stated honestly instead of claimed,
# because the comment above this one has outlived its code twice already.
#
# `mergeDistance: 0` is a SENTINEL, not a distance: it means "merge nothing, but
# still remove faces that are degenerate at any scale". The only threshold
# Blender can express for that is its 1e-6 floor, and whether 1e-6 is safe
# depends on the mesh's LOCAL feature size — nothing else.
#
# Two previous attempts framed this in world space and both were wrong at some
# scale, in opposite directions. Framing it as `1e-6 LOCAL` destroyed a mesh
# whose own local features were 4e-7. Framing it as `1e-6 WORLD / divisor` made
# the gate reduce to `divisor <= 1`, so every object scaled above 1.0 silently
# stopped being repaired — and both fixtures sat at divisor exactly 1.0, which
# is the one value where each bug is invisible.
#
# The question was never about world scale. The dissolve runs on LOCAL
# coordinates, so it is safe exactly when the mesh's smallest real local edge is
# comfortably above the floor. That does not make it scale-INDEPENDENT — a mesh
# authored at 1e-6 local units is still refused where the same world geometry
# authored at 1.0 is repaired — but it does make the decision depend only on
# what the operator can actually see, which is what the previous two framings
# got wrong.
