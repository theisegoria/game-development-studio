# Probe SDK

A small C99 library your engine compiles in to produce a capture bundle the
harness can seal, verify and analyse. There is nothing to link: two source
files, compiled by your build.

```sh
game-dev probe install --project /path/to/engine            # plan
game-dev probe install --project /path/to/engine --confirm  # write
```

That copies `gdprobe.h` and `gdprobe.c` into `third_party/gdprobe/` (or
`--destination RELATIVE`), refuses to overwrite a copy you have changed, and
reports every file with its hash. Or copy `c/gdprobe.h` and `c/gdprobe.c` by
hand; there is nothing else.

## Why it exists

The harness contract is four environment variables and a JSON manifest. It is a
small contract, and every engine that implements it by hand gets the same
handful of things wrong: labels that are not lowercase identifiers, a telemetry
sequence that is not strictly increasing, a manifest written before the files
it names, a row stride assumed to equal `width * 4`. Each one fails validation
*after* the run, when the frame is gone.

So the library's job is not convenience. It is to make an invalid bundle
unrepresentable:

- **You never name a file.** Attachment paths are derived from the frame index
  and kind, so a manifest cannot point outside its run directory.
- **You never choose a sequence number.** The telemetry counter is owned by the
  library, which is what makes "strictly increasing" structural.
- **Labels are slugified.** `"GBuffer Pass"` is accepted and stored as
  `gbuffer-pass` rather than rejected after the run.
- **The manifest is written last.** A process that dies mid-capture leaves no
  manifest at all, so the harness reports a failed run rather than validating a
  manifest that names truncated files.

## What it does not do

It never touches a graphics API. You synchronise, you read back, you hand over a
pointer and say **how** you know the GPU finished. That boundary is what lets one
implementation serve Metal, Vulkan, WebGPU and OpenGL.

## Attestation is an enum, not a boolean

```c
gdprobe_attest_gpu(run, GDPROBE_GPU_FENCE_SIGNALLED, "vkWaitForFences");
```

"I waited on a fence" and "I assume it worked" are different claims, and a
reader of the sealed run deserves to see which one was made. The choice reaches
`adapterEvidence.notes` verbatim.

## Declare a software renderer honestly

```c
gdprobe_declare_backend(run, GDPROBE_BACKEND_VULKAN, "llvmpipe", "24.0",
                        GDPROBE_RENDERER_SOFTWARE);
```

lavapipe, llvmpipe and SwiftShader are not GPUs. If you declare
`GDPROBE_RENDERER_SOFTWARE`, the library **refuses** `gdprobe_attest_gpu` and
`gdprobe_attest_performance` at source, and the harness independently
downgrades any claim that slips through. Declaring it costs nothing you were
entitled to, and keeps the run's evidence true. What a software lane is
genuinely good for is bit-deterministic CI regression at threshold 0.

## Minimal use

```c
gdprobe_status status;
gdprobe_run *run = gdprobe_run_begin(&status);
if (!run) {
  /* GDPROBE_NOT_ATTACHED means you are not under the harness. Keep rendering. */
  return status == GDPROBE_NOT_ATTACHED ? 0 : 1;
}

gdprobe_declare_backend(run, GDPROBE_BACKEND_METAL, "Apple M3", "", GDPROBE_RENDERER_HARDWARE);

gdprobe_frame *frame = gdprobe_frame_begin(run, 0, "main");
gdprobe_attach_rgba8(frame, GDPROBE_KIND_COLOR, NULL, pixels, width, height, row_stride);
gdprobe_attach_ids(frame, GDPROBE_KIND_OBJECT_ID, NULL, object_ids, width, height, id_stride);
gdprobe_frame_end(frame);

gdprobe_emit(run, "performance", "frame_time", 16.7, "ms", 0);
gdprobe_attest_gpu(run, GDPROBE_GPU_COMMANDBUFFER_COMPLETED, "waitUntilCompleted");

if (gdprobe_run_end(run) != GDPROBE_OK) {
  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", gdprobe_last_error(run));
  gdprobe_run_discard(run);
}
```

`row_stride` is bytes per row and is **not** assumed to be `width * 4`. wgpu
aligns copy rows to 256 bytes; reading `width * 4` walks into padding and
records it as image data.

Pass `frame_index` to `gdprobe_emit` whenever a sample belongs to a frame. Only
samples that name a frame can be excluded as warmup later, and shader
compilation in the first frames is the most common source of a false
regression.

## Say how you know, not just what you know

`gdprobe_emit` and `gdprobe_measure` record a number of unknown provenance.
Prefer the `_measured` variants and say what measured it:

```c
gdprobe_emit_measured(run, "render", "pass.gbuffer.gpu_duration_ns", ns, "ns", frame,
                      GDPROBE_MEASURED_GPU_TIMESTAMP_QUERY);
gdprobe_emit_measured(run, "render", "pipeline_statistics.fragment_invocations", n, "count", frame,
                      GDPROBE_MEASURED_PIPELINE_STATISTICS_QUERY);
gdprobe_emit_measured(run, "resource", "vram.used_bytes", bytes, "bytes", -1,
                      GDPROBE_MEASURED_DRIVER_REPORT);
```

A GPU timestamp and a counter your code incremented are identical as doubles;
this is what tells them apart downstream. The harness carries it into the
performance summary, and an optimisation goal that requires a hardware
measurement will refuse a metric of unknown provenance rather than chase a
number nothing measured.

## How it is validated

There are no golden files. A conformance vector generated by the implementation
it validates always passes, which is the failure mode that hides here. Instead,
`tests/probe-sdk.test.ts` compiles `examples/minimal/main.c` with
`-std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror`, runs it through the real harness, and has the
TypeScript side — written independently to the same contract — seal, verify,
decode and analyse what the C code wrote. If the two disagree about the
contract, that test is where it shows.

CI also proves the software lane's one real promise through the shipped CLI
rather than the in-process API (`npm run verify:software-lane`): the minimal
example is compiled under the strictest flags, captured twice, and the two
runs must be byte-identical under `visual compare --threshold 0` and
`visual stability`, while `capture verify` must show the forced downgrade
fired: `rendererClass` software, no GPU or timing claim admitted. The gate
does not skip when no compiler is present; it fails.

## Examples

- `examples/minimal/` — a CPU-filled frame with two objects. No graphics API at
  all, which is the point: it shows exactly what the SDK needs from an engine
  and runs anywhere a C compiler does.
- `examples/metal/` — the same two objects rendered windowless on the GPU.
  Attests completion by a resolved stage-boundary timestamp pair, emits
  per-pass GPU time as `gpu_timestamp_query`, the command buffer's own
  timing as `driver_report`, and the CPU clock as `wall_clock`. macOS only.
