/*
 * gdprobe -- write a Game Development Studio capture bundle from your engine.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The harness contract is four environment variables and a
 * capture manifest. That is a small contract, and every engine that implements
 * it by hand gets the same handful of things wrong: labels that are not
 * lowercase identifiers, a telemetry sequence that is not strictly increasing,
 * a manifest written before the files it names, a row stride assumed to equal
 * width times bytes-per-pixel. Each one fails validation after the run, when
 * the frame is gone.
 *
 * So this library's job is not convenience. It is to make an invalid bundle
 * unrepresentable: the engine cannot name a path, cannot choose a sequence
 * number, and cannot write the manifest early.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It never touches a graphics API. You synchronise, you read
 * back, you hand over a pointer and say how you know the GPU finished. Keeping
 * that boundary means one implementation serves Metal, Vulkan, WebGPU and GL
 * without knowing which one you used.
 *
 * C99, libc only. Compile gdprobe.c into your engine; there is nothing to link
 * and nothing to install.
 *
 * USAGE
 *
 *   gdprobe_run *run = gdprobe_run_begin(NULL);
 *   if (!run) { ... not running under the harness ... }
 *   gdprobe_declare_backend(run, GDPROBE_BACKEND_VULKAN, "llvmpipe", "24.0",
 *                           GDPROBE_RENDERER_SOFTWARE);
 *
 *   gdprobe_frame *frame = gdprobe_frame_begin(run, 0, "main");
 *   gdprobe_attach_rgba8(frame, GDPROBE_KIND_COLOR, NULL, pixels, w, h, stride);
 *   gdprobe_frame_end(frame);
 *
 *   gdprobe_emit(run, "performance", "frame_time", 16.7, "ms", 0);
